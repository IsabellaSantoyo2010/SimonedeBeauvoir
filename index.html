      <td colspan="4"><p data-start="69" data-end="693">Simone de Beauvoir (1908–1986) was a French writer, philosopher, and feminist whose work profoundly shaped 20th-century thought. Born in Paris to a bourgeois family, she excelled academically and later studied philosophy at the Sorbonne, becoming one of the youngest students to pass the highly competitive agrégation. It was during this period that she met Jean-Paul Sartre, forming a lifelong intellectual and personal partnership that would influence both of their careers. Deeply engaged with existentialism, de Beauvoir explored themes of freedom, responsibility, and the human condition in her early novels and essays.</p>
      <p data-start="695" data-end="1310" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Her most influential work, <em data-start="722" data-end="738">The Second Sex</em> (1949), is considered a foundational text of modern feminism, offering a groundbreaking analysis of the ways in which women have been historically oppressed and constructed as &ldquo;the Other.&rdquo; Throughout her life, de Beauvoir was an outspoken advocate for women&rsquo;s rights, social justice, and political causes, using her writing and activism to challenge societal norms. She continued to publish novels, essays, memoirs, and philosophical works until her death in 1986, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire feminist theory and existentialist philosophy worldwide.</p></td>

      <td colspan="4"><p>Simone de Beauvoir was a feminist because she argued that "one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman," asserting that gender is a social construct and that women are oppressed by patriarchal society, which defines them as the inferior "Other" to men. </p>
      <p>Simone de Beauvoir was deeply religious before embracing atheism: Both of De Beauvoir&rsquo;s parents came from bourgeois families. Her father was a legal secretary and an atheist, but her mother was a staunch Catholic and devoted herself to educating her children according to the church&rsquo;s tenets. Along with her younger sister, Simone studied in a strict Catholic school for girls. Throughout her childhood, she followed religious guidance—and even considered a future as a nun. But when she was 14, Simone abandoned her belief in God and became an atheist.</p></td>
